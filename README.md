## Conclusion

_We learnt a lots of new concepts by creating “IRIS: The Virtual Assistant”. It is a desktop application which is well implemented using Python programming. During making of IRIS, we have been through many new concepts such as how to work with multiple modules, inter-communication between modules, threading and database for which we did research and this inturn increased our knowledge._
