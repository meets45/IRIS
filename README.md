# IRIS

IRIS stands for Intelligent and Robust Informaive System.
It was created by Meet Shah(_meets45_) and Yagnik Fadadu(_Yagnikfadadu_) as final year project in Diploma Engineering. 

## Features
1. Type in notepad(realtime) through voice.

2. Sending WhatsApp message to your contacts through voice commands.

3. Vocal Calculator

4. Switch window, know battery percentage or take screenshot through voice and many more features...

## How to use IRIS
i. For using IRIS clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract the contents.

ii. Install the following packages by using this commands
```python
pip install pyttsx3==2.6
pip install SpeechRecognition==3.8.1
pip install wikipedia==1.4.0
pip install requests==2.26.0
pip install PyAutoGUI==0.9.53 
pip install pynput
pip install pywhatkit==5.1
pip install PyPDF2==1.26.0

pip install pyjokes
pip install psutil==5.9.1
pip install PyAudio  
```
iii. Now simply run the IRIS.py file

## Overview of Language

_Python_ - Python is Interpreted high level programming language used for powerful projects our main goal was code readability with indentation.

_SQL_ - SQL is used for storing data in database, we used SQLite3 for storing contacts.

## Scope of Project

The main goal of IRIS is to automize user’s work by thier voice commands. This software will provide hands-free experience of internet related things to user. Curently it supports 3 languages: _English_, _Hindi_ and _Gujarati_.

## Future Enhancements

1. Adding multiple Language support.
2. Adding various Themes in UI.
3. Adding NLP (Natural Language Processing) in IRIS. 

## Conclusion

_We learnt a lots of new concepts by creating “IRIS: The Virtual Assistant”. It is a desktop application which is well implemented using Python programming. During making of IRIS, we have been through many new concepts such as how to work with multiple modules, inter-communication between modules, threading and database for which we did research and this inturn increased our knowledge._
