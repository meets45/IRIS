# IRIS

IRIS means Intelligent and Robust Informaive System.
It was created by Meet Shah(_meets45_) and Yagnik Fadadu(_Yagnikfadadu_) as final year project in Diploma Engineering. 

# How to use IRIS
i. For using IRIS clone the repository or download the Zip file and extract the contents.

ii. Install the following packages by using this commands
```python
pip install pyttsx3==2.6
pip install SpeechRecognition==3.8.1

# Overview of Language

_Python_
Python is Interpreted high level programming language used for powerful projects its main goal is code readability with indentation.

_SQLite_
SQL is used for storing data in database, we used SQLite3 for storing contacts and emails.

# Scope of Project

The main goal of IRIS is to automize user’s work by his/her voice commands. This software will provide hands-free experience of internet related things to user. User can
also write with his voice in Notepad. 

# Future Enhancements

1. Adding multiple Language support.
2. Adding various Themes in UI.
3. Adding NLP (Natural Language Processing) in IRIS. 

# Conclusion

_We learnt a lots of new concepts by creating “IRIS: The Virtual Assistant”. It is a desktop application which is well implemented using Python programming. During making of IRIS, we have been through many new concepts such as how to work with multiple modules, inter-communication between modules, threading and database for which we did research and this inturn increased our knowledge._
